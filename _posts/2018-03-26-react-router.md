#### What is React Router?

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is a popular library used by React Applications. It's actively maintained and is undergoing major changes over the years. This year, a full revamp was released with version 4.
It bundles a set of Components used for navigation. As you know, React is used for creating single page applications. With the help of React Router, you can have the benefits of multiple views under different urls, nested routes, etc.

#### Exercises

- Create a new React application

- Create a Navbar Component. This component will have links to different sections of your application.

- Under the Navbar Component, create links to: "Rock Paper Scissors Game" and "Countries List".

- Create components for each of those Views.

- Move code from past projects into this new project.

- Clicking on each Link should allow the user to see the respective project. These sub-projects should still work. If you have done it right, it should be very easy to reuse your old projects!
