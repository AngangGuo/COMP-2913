#### Getting started

Please refer to this page:
[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html)

There's a guide on how to create a new React app. We will do this together in class. Note that instructions may change, depending on your Operating System.

#### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

As a Programmer, you will need to have your computer setup to simplify your work flow as much as possible. I recommend setting up a laptop that you can bring to class. Otherwise, you may need to setup your environment every time you come into class. There are dozens that you may chose from, here are the ones I've seen used most often
by JavaScript programmers:

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

  A free, open-source, modern and extendable text-editor, developed by [Github](https://github.com/).
  The community is very active, and you will find plugins that can deeply customize your workflow.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

  A widely-used fast and simple text-editor. It's free to try out, but requires a licence if you plan
  on using it over time.

- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

  A powerful IDE developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), who are highly regarded for their advanced development tools. It has a yearly cost.

#### After choosing your IDE

Once you've decided on your IDE, you will need to download plugins to simplify your React development.
Each IDE has their own way to be customized, so you may need to do some research on how to do it for your chosen software. Here are some recommended plugins that exist across most IDEs:

- ##### Syntax Highlighting for React/JSX

  You will want to have this setup, so that your code is easier to read. React uses a variation of JavaScript, that includes syntax for JSX. By default, no IDEs will know how to syntax highlight this.

- ##### ESLint

  Linters are programs that analyse code for potential errors. When programming in JavaScript,
  you should have ESLint to help you do so. You will also need to have ESLint setup to understand JSX as well!
