Please see [React - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) for up to date examples.

#### Exercise:

- Create a "LoginView" component, and render it under <App />.

- "LoginView" should have an initialState for empty "username" and "password".

- Render an input for your username, and one for your password, nested under a form.

- Also add submit button to the form.

- Use your inputs as controlled inputs, meaning that the source of truth for their value is
in the component state.

- onSubmit, prevent default. Log the username and password onto the console.
