#### COMP-2913 - What's next?

After 6 weeks going through the basics of React, you should now be comfortable with the basic concepts of this library, as well as having a good understanding of how to structure a React application. This does not mean that your learning can stop though; There are still a few advanced features that React offers, as well as more abstract concepts on structuring reliable, flexible and scaleable projects, which can only be learned through practice.

In large applications, maintaining state that needs to be shared with multiple components simultaneously can be hard, with Component state alone. In such cases, using a state management library might be ideal.
