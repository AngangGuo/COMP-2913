- Form must include all properties of car items specified. Use data types that fit the data.

  - price

  - new/old

- When a new item is added, it should be displayed at the end of the full car list.

#### Exercise 2:

- Create a "LoginView" component, and render it under <App />.

- "LoginView" should have an initialState for empty "username" and "password".

- Render an input for your username, and one for your password, nested under a form.

- Also add submit button to the form.

- Use your inputs as controlled inputs, meaning that the source of truth for their value is
in the component state.

- onSubmit, use the API below to login.

- Display a loading spinner while the login response is pending.

- If the login credentials are wrong, display an invalid credentials message.

- If the login credentials are correct, display a Welcome message instead.
