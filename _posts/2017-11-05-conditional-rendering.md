In your application, depending on the state, you may want to display/hide certain things.

Examples of when conditional rendering can be used:

- If a user is logged in, you may want to display a welcome message. Otherwise, you may want to display a Login button.

- If your current physical location is displayed on the map, you may want to display a pin icon.

- If there are results for your search, you may want to display a list. Otherwise, you may want to display a "no results found" message.

Please see [React - Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) for up to date examples.
