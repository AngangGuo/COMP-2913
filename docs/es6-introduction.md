#### What is ECMA?
ECMA is the organization responsible for defining a standard for the JavaScript programming language, also known as ECMAScript.
They have commited to yearly updates to the JavaScript language, although each browser is free to implement them at their own pace.

#### What is ECMAScript?
ECMAScript is a standardized name for JavaScript.

##### What is ES6?
ES6 refers to ECMAScript 6, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.
This is the first version of JavaScript where major improvements have been made. Most modern browsers support most of the ES6 features natively by now, but in order to support backwards compatibility, "transpiling" can be used to "translate" and "compile" to ES5.

You are not required to know all ES6 features, as some of them are not even supported	
in some browsers yet. There are a few though, that are very useful and I recommend that you are familiar with them.
Be sure to read the in-depth explanations linked from the pages here.

#### What's after ES6?
ES7, ES8, ES9 and so on. Some of the features in these ECMAScript versions are also available to use in modern browsers. You can also use transpiling
tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), to use these newer features with backwards compoatibility.
