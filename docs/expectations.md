- It is expected of students that they have a basic grasp of JavaScript. If rusty, reviewing at home is strongly recommended.
- This course can be challenging, so please review course material between classes.
- Quizzes and assignments can be challenging. Just because they are open-book, does not mean they are easy.

### How to ask questions

To get the most out of this course, and to help the class run as smoothly as possible, please follow these guidelines:

- There are bad questions, but no *dumb* ones, from what I have experienced until now (This may change in the future if I'm proven wrong). If you don't know something, even if very basic, please reach out for help. Everybody has had the same questions at some point in their studies/career. If you're uncomfortable asking in front of the class, feel free to reach out individually. We are all here to learn.

- There are no dumb questions, but there are questions that are *too* smart. Keep in mind that we have a limited amount of time in the classroom, and we want to keep all students involved. If you have a question that is more advanced, feel free to ask me individually. Let's respect everybody's time during class!

- Try to ask specific questions. "My project doesn't work, what's wrong?" is not a good question. This will help me improve my debugging skills, but not yours. Instead, try: "I'm getting error "x". What's wrong?".

- Try to break down your problems, so that you only have 1 question at a time. If you are running into multiple problems at once, chances are that you're trying to do too much simultaneously.

#### Examples of bad questions:

- My project doesn't work, what's wrong?

- My project doesn't compile. What's wrong? (code is badly indented, making it hard to track syntax errors).

- What's the minimum I need to do to pass the course?

- How to I handle OAuth in a React application? (not relevant to the rest of the students)

#### Examples of good questions:

- I'm getting error "x". What's wrong?

- My project doesn't compile. My code is well organized but I can't track the syntax error.

- What's a good source to learn more about ES6?

- What's the correct way of handling click events on list items?

- Is there a better way to set component state?
