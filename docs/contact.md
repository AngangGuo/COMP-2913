If you have questions, concerns, suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out through the email address below. I usually check my BCIT Email at night, so I may not be able to respond right away.
In regards to questions regarding code, I suggest that you try finding the solutions through your own research and findings. Finding problems in code is a very important skill for programmers and you can only get good at it by doing it yourself. If you feel like you are truly blocked, Iâ€™d be more than happy to help out then.
