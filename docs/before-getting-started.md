As React is still evolving, often new tools and features are added over time. In this class,
I'll link to the actual React documentation, so that we have access to the latest up-to-date information.
Please keep in mind that although the core concepts of the React library will likely not change drastically, often the API (Application Programming Interface) will. In order to ensure that these notes are always up to date, I'll link to the actual React documentation when applicable.
Also, as some initial setup is needed in order to run React on your computer, I strongly suggest that if you have a personal laptop, that you use it instead of BCIT's lab computers. This will save you the trouble of having to setup your machine every class.
