### Quiz Grading criteria

Quizzes are composed of multiple choice, multiple select and true/false questions.

For multiple select questions, partials marks may be awarded for partially correct answers. Note that in such cases, the criteria follows the "Right minus wrong" formula.

| Breakdown                      |       |
| :----------------------------- | :---- |
| Application works as requested | 50%   |
| Clean, readable code           | 15%   |

| Submitted project as requested | 5%    |

---

#### Application works as requested

Does it meet all functional requirements?

---

#### Clean, readable code

Is the code clean and concise? Are the variables named appropriately? Does the code follow a standard? (eg. proper code line alignment, consistent standards). Is there commented out code that is not being used? Good code is easy to understand and is not complicated for the sake of being complex.

---

#### Applied good structure

Did you follow good coding and React practices? Did you apply concepts learned in class? Avoid copy/pasting from other websites, sometimes they use older versions of React, other libraries, etc. Feel free to read and learn from them, but only transfer to your code what you understand.

---

#### Submitted project as requested

Did you submit your files as specified and on time? Is your name on the project?

---

#### Submitting Projects/Final

In [D2L](http://learn.bcit.ca), look for the React course, and select Assignments. There should be folders for each project.
Ensure that you **do not include** the node_modules folder in your project when submitting.
Zip your React app folder and name it {projectNumber}_{firstName}_{lastName}.
Eg. project1_daniel_takeuchi.zip
