### Project 1 - To Do App

Weight: 25%

Due Date: Beginning of Class 5 (November 21st, 2017)

#### Requirements

1. Create a new React application, name it "todo-app".

1. This app will display a text input for the user, where they will be able to write a task.

1. A button should be displayed beside the input. When clicked, this button should add the user's input to a list of to do items.

1. Blank items should not be added to the list. This can happen if the user presses the "Add" button without writing down a task.

1. The list could potentially have 0 to multiple items.

1. Each list item must display a checkbox, and the task that the user wrote.

1. When checking off the checkbox, the list item should be removed from the list.

1. Ensure that you make use of Components intelligently. Think about what should be extracted into a separate component, and do so.
