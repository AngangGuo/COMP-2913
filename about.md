COMP-2913 - React & Modern JavaScript is a new course I've been preparing, and this is the first time it will be taught at BCIT. The tech industry is ever-evolving, and new technologies, tools and techniques are emerging constantly. In other to teach a relevant course for today's job market, this course will not only focus on JavaScript and React, but on development techniques using widely used tools. I also hope to bring my experience as a current Developer, in order to help clarify any questions students may have about working in the field.
