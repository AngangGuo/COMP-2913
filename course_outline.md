### Course Outline
React is an open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
This challenging, hands-on courses follows on from COMP 1850 and COMP 2015 and is aimed at students who already understand how to build web pages with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The main goal of using React is to create fast and modular applications. Students begin with an introduction to the basic concepts of React and how it works with the browser Document Object Model. Other topics include JavaScript, ES6, JSX, Redux and React Router.
Instructor led labs and exercises focus on how to structure and develop single-page applications following current industry standards.

### Submitting Homework
All Labs, Assignments and Exam should be submitted through [Desire2Learn (learn.bcit.ca)](learn.bcit.ca).
There will be a Dropbox for your course. It can be located at: COMP2015 -> Activities -> Dropbox. Each lab, assignment and exam will have their own directories. Always zip your deliverables, and rename the file in this format: lab1_firstname_lastname.zip
You would be surprised by how often deliverables are handed in without a name. Marks will be deducted if no name is provided, assuming I can find it’s owner.
Ideally, please try to submit your deliverables on time. I’ll be as flexible as possible, as I know students also have other important priorities. It would really help me though, if you strive to meet the given deadlines.
This also goes with submitting the same assignment multiple times. I will only mark the latest one submitted, but I would also appreciate if this is avoided as much as possible.

### Contact
If you have questions, concerns, suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out through the email address below. I usually check my BCIT Email at night, so I may not be able to respond right away.
In regards to questions regarding code, I suggest that you try finding the solutions through your own research and findings. Finding problems in code is a very important skill for programmers and you can only get good at it by doing it yourself. If you feel like you are truly blocked, I’d be more than happy to help out then.
