### Course Outline

React is an open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
This challenging, hands-on courses follows on from COMP 1850 and COMP 2015 and is aimed at students who already understand how to build web pages with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The main goal of using React is to create fast and modular applications. Students begin with an introduction to the basic concepts of React and how it works with the browser Document Object Model. Other topics include JavaScript, ES6, JSX, Redux and React Router.
Instructor led labs and exercises focus on how to structure and develop single-page applications following current industry standards.

### Submitting Homework
All Labs, Assignments and Exam should be submitted through [Desire2Learn (learn.bcit.ca)](learn.bcit.ca).
There will be a Dropbox for your course. It can be located at: COMP2913 -> Activities -> Assignments. Each lab, assignment and exam will have their own directories. Always zip your deliverables, and rename the file in this format: lab1_firstname_lastname.zip
You would be surprised by how often deliverables are handed in without a name. Marks will be deducted if no name is provided.
Ideally, please try to submit your deliverables on time. I’ll be as flexible as possible, as I know students also have other important priorities. It would really help me though, if you strive to meet the given deadlines. For Project 3, the due date is non-negotiable, as I also have a deadline to submit final marks to Administration.
This also goes with submitting the same assignment multiple times. I will only mark the latest one submitted, but I would also appreciate if this is avoided as much as possible.
Searching for help online is okay and sometimes, necessary. We will learn the basic building blocks necessary for each assignment in class, but it is up to you to apply your knowledge and creativity to finding solutions.
Copy/pasting code from online tutorials is not recommended. You will not learn much by doing it so, and often, they don't fully fulfill the requirements for the given assignments.

### Course Expectations
- It is expected of students that they have a basic grasp of JavaScript. If rusty, reviewing at home is strongly recommended.
- This course can be challenging, so please review course material between classes.
- Quizzes and assignments can be challenging. Just because they are open-book, does not mean they are easy.

### How to ask questions

I used to believe that there were no bad questions. Over time, I learned that this is not true.
To get the most out of this course, and to help the class run as smoothly as possible, please follow these guidelines:

- There are bad questions, but no *dumb* ones, from what I have experienced until now (This may change in the future if I'm proven wrong). If you don't know something, even if very basic, please reach out for help. Everybody has had the same questions at some point in their studies/career. If you're uncomfortable asking in front of the class, feel free to reach out individually. We are all here to learn.

- There are no dumb questions, but there are questions that are *too* smart. Keep in mind that we have a limited amount of time in the classroom, and we want to keep all students involved. If you have a question that is more advanced, feel free to ask me individually. Let's respect everybody's time during class!

- Try to ask specific questions. "My project doesn't work, what's wrong?" is not a good question. This will help me improve my debugging skills, but not yours. Instead, try: "I'm getting error "x". What's wrong?".

- Try to break down your problems, so that you only have 1 question at a time. If you are running into multiple problems at once, chances are that you're trying to do too much simultaneously.

#### Examples of bad questions:

- My project doesn't work, what's wrong?

- My project doesn't compile. What's wrong? (code is badly indented, making it hard to track syntax errors).

- What's the minimum I need to do to pass the course?

- How to I handle OAuth in a React application? (not relevant to the rest of the students)

#### Examples of good questions:

- I'm getting error "x". What's wrong?

- My project doesn't compile. My code is well organized but I can't track the syntax error.

- What's a good source to learn more about ES6?

- What's the correct way of handling click events on list items?

- Is there a better way to set component state?

### Contact
If you have questions, concerns, suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out through the email address below. I usually check my BCIT Email at night, so I may not be able to respond right away.
In regards to questions regarding code, I suggest that you try finding the solutions through your own research and findings. Finding problems in code is a very important skill for programmers and you can only get good at it by doing it yourself. If you feel like you are truly blocked, I’d be more than happy to help out then.
